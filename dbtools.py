# This tool is designed for identifying inconsistencies in MongoDB databases
# based on pre-defined models. It supports automated analysis over multiple
# databases located on multiple servers as a single batch operation. It is
# structured with memory efficiency as a priority, requiring the minimum amount
# of memory possible for each operation.
